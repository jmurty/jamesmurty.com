I am pleased to announce that my book *Programming Amazon Web Services:
S3, EC2, SQS, FPS and SimpleDB* is now officially published and should
soon be available from booksellers. It will hopefully prove to be a
valuable resource for people who are building applications on top of
Amazon's infrastructure services, or who are considering doing so.

You can find out more about the book or order a copy from the [O'Reilly
catalog][] or [Amazon.com][] (affiliate link).

The book contains a large number of code examples written in Ruby,
including example client implementations for all five infrastructure
services. This code, as well as corresponding implementations written in
Java and Python, will shortly be available for download from the
O'Reilly catalog page. There is also a [forum][] where you can discuss
the book or ask questions.
