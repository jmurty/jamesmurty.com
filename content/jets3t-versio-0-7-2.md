As of a couple of weeks ago the latest version of JetS3t **0.7.2** has
been available as a public release. In the pre-holiday rush I forgot to
post a notification to my own blog.

This release includes some bug fixes, more sophisticated configuration
options for the "filecomparer" component that manages file
synchronizations, and supports the two major new CloudFront API
features: private distributions and streaming distributions.

Visit the [JetS3t web site][] to download the latest release and view
the latest documentation such as [code samples][] and the [API
Javadoc][].

You can read about the complete list of changes in the [release
notes][]. And for the Maven-ites among you the [official Maven2
repository][] has also been updated.
