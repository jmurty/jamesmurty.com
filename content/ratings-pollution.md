I'm thinking of buying Michael Lewis' new book, *The Big Short*. So I
visit the Amazon site and see a pretty terrible average review of only
2.5 stars. What gives?

Turns out a bunch of douches have given the book [one-star reviews][]
because the book is not yet available on the Kindle.

Not only are they submitting low reviews because they cannot yet buy the
book in their preferred form -- a decision that is most likely made by
the publisher not the author -- but they are doing so without even
reading the book. This is a whiny and pathetic form of "protest" that
does nothing but pollute the digital commons. Grow up folks!
