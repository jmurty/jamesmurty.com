An interesting post with some drawbacks of cloud computing and EC2, from
those in the trenches: [Real-world cloud computing][].

There are some real gems here, such as:

> -   [They all] used Amazon services, and most if not all of them
>     seemed to use RightScale to manage them.
> -   Cost: cloud is more expensive than real machines. Cloud is good
>     for elastic computing, not for high constant demand.
> -   You need monitoring services external to your cloud!
