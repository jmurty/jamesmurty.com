Amazon staff member Jinesh Varia has written a white paper in two parts
that describes a "cloud architecture" application built on the SQS, EC2,
S3 and SimpleDB services, and discusses best practices for using these
services.

This paper is an excellent resource for anyone designing a scalable
application based on AWS, especially Part 2 and the section "Tips for
Designing a Cloud Architecture Application" in Part 1.

The paper is available as web pages here:

-   [Building GrepTheWeb in the Cloud, Part 1: Cloud Architectures][]
-   [Building GrepTheWeb in the Cloud, Part 2: Best Practices][]

There is also a [PDF document][] version that includes a bonus extra: an
appendix that summarizes the differences between the three data storage
services -- S3, SQS, and SimpleDB -- and explains which service is most
appropriate for particular tasks.
