The eagle-eyed folks at [RightScale have spotted][] a new EC2 feature
guide document describing the long-anticipated release of [Amazon EC2
Regions][]. In short, EC2 is now available in the EU region, with
potentially more regions to follow.

This is great news for EC2 users who are located in Europe, or who have
a large customer base there. Keep an eye out for more official
announcements and explanations of this major new feature.

### Updates

The AWS blog has a [post with some more details][]. DevPay and Windows
AMIs are not yet available in the European EC2, but all other features
are supported. Pricing is also slightly higher in the EU region, as it
is for S3 storage outside the U.S.
