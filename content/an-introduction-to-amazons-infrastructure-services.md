Here is a video interview with Jeff Barr from Amazon.com talking about
the AWS infrastructure services â€“ [Amazon's Challenge to Business: Turn
Off Your Datacenter][]. The video gives an introduction to the services,
followed by some in-depth technical discussion.

If you are new to the Amazon Web Services, this is a great
starting-point.
