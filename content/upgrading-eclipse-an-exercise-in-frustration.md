I am keen to try out Amazon's new [AWS Toolkit for Eclipse][] which adds
EC2 instance management and direct deployment into the [Eclipse IDE][].

However, I have just wasted my afternoon trying to upgrade to a new
version of Eclipse that:

1.  Is version 3.3 or later, to be compatible with Amazon's toolkit
2.  Includes the Web Tools Platform, ditto
3.  Actually works, without weird graphics glitches (Ganymede/3.4) or
    broken components out-of-the-box (Europa/3.3)

This reminds me why I've stuck with Eclipse version 3.2 for years --
every update is a huge pain.

Anyhow, that's enough whining for now. I'm writing this post in the hope
that I can come back and update it with some solutions if/when I figure
out how to get this stuff working.
