Amazon's CloudFront service will have [new pricing tiers][] from
February 1.

On a related note, here are some [tools for using CloudFront][].

The next version of my [JetS3t suite][] will also include support for
CloudFront at the API level and in the Cockpit graphical application.
I'm planning to release this by February, but if you are keen you can
can get a sneak-peek at the [pre-release beta version][].
