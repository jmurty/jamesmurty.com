## James Murty

I am a software developer and technical writer with extensive experience
creating web-based applications and architectures. With a working background
spanning a research institute, small software houses and various corporations,
I have a broad perspective on both the potential and the pitfalls in building
networked applications.

I am from Australia but currently live in London, UK.

## This site

On this web site I will discuss coding, writing, thinking, and other topics
that interest me, in a modest effort to capture some small sense of my
ever-evolving present.

"Post past" has two meanings:

-   It is everything that happens from this moment, from the now we live
    to the future we create. It encompasses the whole grand sweep of
    history to come.
-   It is also an old, neglected term for a small portion of food eaten
    after a meal. A tasty snack, if you will.

Hopefully you will find a bit of both on this site.
