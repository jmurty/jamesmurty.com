I have just released JetS3t version **0.7.3** following the
[announcement][] earlier this week that S3 Versioning has graduated to
production status.

This release includes:

-   support for new S3 features [Bucket Versioning and Multi-Factor Authentication for delete][]
-   updates to the CloudFront service to support the 2010-03-01 API with
    private streaming buckets.
-   bug fixes

Visit the [JetS3t web site][] to download the latest release and view
the latest [code samples][] and [API Javadoc][].
The [official Maven2 repository][] should be updated in the next day or so.

Read about the complete list of changes in the [release notes][], and
visit the [development site][] to submit bug reports or contribute to
the project.
