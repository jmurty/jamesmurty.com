A handy new graphical tool for working with the Amazon Simple DB service
has been announced on the [AWS Blog][]. [SDB Tool][] is a Firefox plugin
for querying and updating your Simple DB database domains.

The tool is very functional, if a bit rough around the edges. The
interface is a bit intimidating and, on my computer at least, it has a
nasty habit of resizing my Firefox browser window when I start it up.
However, even at this early stage the plugin provides a straight-forward
graphical view into your data that will be very valuable for anyone
working with data stored in Simple DB.

Kudos to [Bizo, Inc][] for developing this tool, and releasing it for
everyone's benefit.
