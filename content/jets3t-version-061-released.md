I am pleased to announce the release of JetS3t version 0.6.1, the newest
version of my open source Java S3 library and application suite.

This release includes bug fixes, application improvements, and support
for some of the newest features of Amazon's Simple Storage Service
([S3][]). Highlights include:

-   Support for copying, moving, and renaming S3 objects with the
    programming toolkit and Cockpit application
-   The metadata associated with objects can now be updated without the
    need to upload an object again
-   Improved data verification options for ensuring that information is
    not corrupted in transit
-   The Synchronize application supports new options to improve
    performance and decrease memory requirements when synchronizing
    large numbers of files.

You can download version 0.6.1 from the [JetS3t Downloads][] page. The
web site has also been updated with the latest application manuals, code
samples, and API documentation.

Enjoy!
