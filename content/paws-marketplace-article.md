I have added an article about my PAWS Marketplace example application to
the AWS resources site: [PAWS Marketplace - A Rails Marketplace
Application in the Cloud][].

The PAWS Marketplace is a proof-of-concept Ruby on Rails web application
that runs entirely on Amazon Web Services. The application’s web site
allows anyone with an Amazon Payments account to buy or sell digital
products, while the marketplace’s owner earns commissions for the sales
it performs. In addition to serving as an example marketplace
implementation, this application is interesting because it uses the
SimpleDB service to store its data instead of a traditional relational
database.

The article describes how to install and run the marketplace web site
yourself. It also includes links to the example code, and to a
screencast video that demonstrates how to configure and use the
marketplace web site.
