To celebrate the three year birthday of its Simple Storage Service (S3),
Amazon has announced reduced pricing for uploads for the next three
months. From April to June 2009, uploads into S3 will cost 3¢ per
Gigabyte instead of 10¢.

The announcement is at the top of the [Amazon S3 home page][] and the
service's [pricing details][] have been updated. This makes it a good
time to send your data to the cloud.
