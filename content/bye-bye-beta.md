Google's Gmail and Google Apps are [no longer][] [BETA][] products.

I guess that means that not only has the designation "beta" been
stripped of any real meaning on the modern web, but even the decision to
leave beta status can be taken on a whim. Perhaps there is a tangible
reason -- aside from marketing towards the big end of town -- that
prompted Google to remove the beta status from their products today.
Perhaps. But if so, the reason isn't explained in these blog posts.

Don't get me wrong, I am a long-time user of both of these products and
I consider them invaluable tools of very high quality. The tech is
great. I just get annoyed when large companies, through carelessness or
malice, misuse words and destroy their semantic value.
