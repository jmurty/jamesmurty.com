It's been quiet here for a while; it's about time I announced a new
project.

Last week I released the first alpha version of [xml4h][], a library I
have created to make it easier to do non-trivial XML processing in
Python.

You can find it on:

-   PyPI for installation using *pip*: [pypi.python.org/pypi/xml4h][]
-   GitHub for code and issue tracking: [github.com/jmurty/xml4h][xml4h]
-   ReadTheDocs for (pretty comprehensive) documentation:
    [xml4h.readthedocs.org][]

I made *xml4h* because I enjoy working with Python -- it's been my
language of choice for a while now -- but I always found it painful to
work with XML using the tools available there. Of course, dealing with
XML tends to be painful in its own right, but the existing Python tools
only made it harder. Although there was an excellent base of fast,
efficient and powerful XML processing tools, interacting with them
always seemed to be harder than it should be.

For years I kept an eye out for a better way, until finally of got off
my arse and built it myself.

Right now *xml4h* is young, a little rough, and likely to undergo
changes: in other words it's an alpha. My hope is it will grow quickly
into a powerful and intuitive tool that makes it as easy to do XML in
Python as it now is to [do HTTP][] or to [do SQL][].

If you're into Python and have felt XML-induced pain, it would be great
if you could try it out and provide feedback, bug reports, and code to
help move the project in the right direction.

Let's make this thing awesome.
