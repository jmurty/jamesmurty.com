Do you use Amazon Web Services for research purposes at a university, or
as part of a university course?

If so, you should look into Amazon's new **AWS in Education** initiative
which provides AWS service credits to members of the academic community.
You can apply for credit programs designed for researchers, educators,
student groups, or university IT departments. Check out the [AWS in
Education][] home page, and the [announcement][] on the AWS blog.
